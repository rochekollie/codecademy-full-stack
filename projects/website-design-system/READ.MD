# Website Design System

## Instructions

In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like. You can take a look at our [basic example site](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/website-design-system/example/index.html?_gl=1*1bnxxbk*_ga*MjE0NDg4NjUyNi4xNjUxNDYzNzE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY1MzcxNDM2OC40NC4xLjE2NTM3MjA1MDUuNTU.) for a taste of what you’ll be building (yours will be customized).
